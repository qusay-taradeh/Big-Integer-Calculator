# Big Integer Calculator
An application that performs arithmetic operations on very large integers using doubly linked lists.

## Summary
This project implements a large integer calculator to handle arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large numbers. Due to limitations in floating-point representations that can lead to overflow, this application provides a reliable way to perform calculations using linked lists. The program can execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on large integers efficiently.

## Specifications
This application should be able to perform the following tasks:
1. Read a file containing at least two numbers to perform operations.
2. Represent large integers as doubly linked lists for efficient processing.
3. Perform arithmetic operations:
   - **Addition** of two large integers.
   - **Subtraction** of one large integer from another.
   - **Multiplication** using standard multiplication, where the first multiplicand is multiplied by each digit of the second multiplicand and then added.
   - **Division** implemented as long division.
4. Implement additional functions to determine the relative magnitude of two numbers (e.g., checking if the dividend is larger than the divisor in absolute value).
5. Allow the user to select operations via a menu-driven interface.
6. Provide options to print results to an output file.
7. Exit the program gracefully.
